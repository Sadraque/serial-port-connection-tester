# serialPortConnectionTester
<h3>A simple program to test the connection with serial ports</h3>
<br>
<p><b>-></b> The program was made using Java with the Serial Library of the Processing API</p>
<p>-> You can donwload the Processing API on <a href ="https://processing.org/">https://processing.org</a></p>
<br>
<p><b>-></b> To use the Processing API on your code you need to extend the Processing PApplet on your class: <br>
  <b>Example:</b><br>
  public class test extends PPapplet(){
  }
</p>
<br>
<p><b>-></b> To use the serial Library you need to copy the follow libs to your project directory: CORE, SERIAL and JSSC<br>

  You can copy this files on the example directory bellow: 
  <br>
  C:\Program Files\processing-3.5.4\core\library<br>
  C:\Program Files\processing-3.5.4\modes\java\libraries\serial\library
  <br>
  </p>
<p><b>-></b> The jSSC-2.8.dll is needed for the serial library work. You should copy this dll on your System32 directory on windows. </p><p>The dll is located for example on: C:\Program Files\processing-3.5.4\modes\java\libraries\serial\library, inside the windows32 and windows64 folder.</p><p> If your operating system is 32 bits copy the dll of the windows32 folder, but If your operating system is 64 bits copy the dll of the windows64 folder</p>
